# Fake News Detection (Internship Project)

This project was completed as part of my internship. The goal of the project was to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## Domain
NLP + Machine Learning (Text Classification)

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean textual news data
- Extract text features (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words)
- Train ML models for binary classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / Text Processing Libraries

## Skills Gained
- NLP Text Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Classification Metrics
- Handling Imbalanced Data (if applicable)

## Dataset
Internship-provided news dataset / Kaggle Fake News Dataset

## Results
Model successfully trained and evaluated (see notebook)

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install required libraries
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter
4. Run cells sequentially

## Status
Completed as part of internship deliverables.
